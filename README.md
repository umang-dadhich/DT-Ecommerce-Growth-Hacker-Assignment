# 📊 HealthCare Boost - Profitability Analysis Model

Welcome to the **HealthCare Boost Profitability Analysis** project! 🚀  
This repository contains a dynamic and editable **Google Sheet Model** built for evaluating the **unit economics** and **campaign profitability** of a fictional health supplement brand, **HealthCare Boost**, that sells on Amazon.

The goal?  
👉 **Figure out the maximum Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** while staying profitable, and explore how different business variables like volume, pricing, or fixed costs affect the brand's financials.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

A clean and interactive spreadsheet template to help marketers and business analysts:

- 📌 Analyze product profitability on Amazon
- 🎯 Determine target CAC for campaigns
- 📉 Simulate impact of sales drop, cost hikes, or price changes
- 📈 Visualize profitability through dynamic charts and color-coded alerts

## ⚙️ Model Structure

The spreadsheet is structured into **3 main sections**:

### 1. 🔢 Input Section (Editable Fields)

Update the assumptions to reflect real-world or test-case scenarios:

| Variable                         | Default Value | Description                            |
|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Selling Price (SP)              | $30           | Price at which product is sold         |
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)       | $15           | Cost to produce each unit              |
| Amazon Fee (%)                  | 15%           | Commission charged by Amazon           |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | Editable      | Cost per new customer from campaigns   |
| Units Sold                      | 5,000         | Monthly volume sold                    |
| Corporate Fixed Costs           | $10,000       | Fixed company overheads                |
| Bank Loan Interest              | $1,500        | Monthly interest payments              |
| Tax Rate                        | 20%           | Applicable tax on net profit           |

---

### 2. 📈 Output Section (Auto Calculations)

These values update automatically based on the inputs:

- **Gross Margin per Unit**: `SP - COGS`
- **Amazon Fee (per unit)**: `SP * 15%`
- **Net Margin (per unit)**: `Gross Margin - Amazon Fee - CAC`
- **Monthly Profit Before Tax**: `Net Margin × Units Sold - Fixed Costs - Interest`
- **Profit After Tax**: `Profit Before Tax × (1 - Tax Rate)`

---

### 3. 📊 Visual Dashboard

- Conditional formatting to highlight **loss-making scenarios** (red alert 🔴)
- Charts showing how profitability shifts with CAC, volume, price, and more
- Interactive simulations to **test your assumptions in real time**

---

## 🔍 Explore These Key Scenarios

### 1. 💰 Break-Even CAC (Target TACOS)
**Q:** What’s the maximum CAC we can afford while selling 5,000 units?  
💡 *Adjust the CAC until Profit After Tax = $0.*

---

### 2. 📉 Volume Sensitivity
**Q:** What happens if sales drop to 4,000 units?  
💡 *Change “Units Sold” and observe how CAC needs to be adjusted to remain profitable.*

---

### 3. 🏗️ Fixed Cost Hike
**Q:** If fixed costs increase by $5,000, how much extra volume or margin is needed?  
💡 *Increase fixed costs to $15,000 and tweak volume or SP to regain profitability.*

---

### 4. 💵 Price Optimization
**Q:** How does increasing the price to $35 affect profitability?  
💡 *Update the “Selling Price” field and check how much CAC flexibility increases.*

---

### 5. 🧾 Tax Rate Changes
**Q:** What if the tax rate rises to 25%?  
💡 *Adjust tax rate input and monitor after-tax profit impact.*

## 📌 Actionable Insights

- If CAC is too high → reduce ad costs, improve conversion, or increase AOV
- If volume drops → cut fixed expenses or find alternate sales channels
- If fixed costs go up → focus on operational efficiency or scale faster
